currently under construction but heres the vision:
<br></br>
a searchable database of pride flags containing images, creators, years, titles
<br></br>
public API to hook into to use specific pride flag images for your needs
<br></br>
Pride-le minigame using pride flag db as backend - a wordle like game where users guess which pride flag (Name and Year) is hidden behind the black tiles
  (tier 2 to include stats, etc and a seperarate client-facing page for the game only)
