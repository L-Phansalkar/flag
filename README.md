# the vision:

a comprehensive database of pride flags, years, and variations

public API to hook into to use specific pride flag images for your needs

guess the flag minigame using pride flag db as backend

** _site is currently live and well_ \***

# hooking into the api:

<h3>
          to hook into the API, go to
  <br/>http://pr1deflags.herokuapp.com/allflags<br/> find the flag name, year, and alternate name (altname) if it has one. Alternate names are used to differentiate flags of the same type created in the same year
        </h3>
        <h3>the API name is all lowercase and the structure is as follows: </h3>
        <h1 id="thestructure">
          http://pr1deflags.herokuapp.com/flags/flag name (+ flag altname) + flag year + .png</b>
        </h1>

# tier 2 updates to come:

universal flag randomization for minigame

renaming ouliers to fit better into the

definition of LGBTQIA+ labels (flag names)

Hi, my name is L Phansalkar, I am a fullstack engineer, and I am so excited to present my latest project - pr1deflags. I created this database and API after being unable to find a comprehensive, developer-friendly accumulation of pride flag images. While building pr1deflags, I realized that there was also a gap in user-friendly databases that display all flag images and info neatly on one page for browsing and education. I combined these two goals, and pr1deflags was born. Currently, the site features images of 59 pride flags, their creators (if known), and their controversial status (some flags are considered controversial because the views or intent of their creator). The homepage of the site features clear instructions on how to hook into the API to make use of the image database, a link to view all flags, and a link to the flag guessing mini-game that sparked this project. I hope you find it just as useful, informative, and exciting as I do. If you have feedback - either about the site and api or about the flags listed - I welcome hearing from you! The feedback link is in the footer of the homepage. Thank you and enjoy pr1deflags!
